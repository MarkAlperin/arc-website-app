# ARC Calendar App

## About

An event calendar app for a local marksmanship organization. It allows administrators to create new events and regular users to view those events through an interactive calendar. This app is my first React project; it was built during a two-day sprint. It uses Google Firebase Realtime Database on the back-end to store its event data.
